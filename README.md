- [Shayan Maleki](https://github.com/maleki-shayan)

## Features
- **Core Gameplay**:
  - 5 unique plant types (Peashooter, Snowpea, KernelPult, Sunflower, Walnut)
  - 2 zombie types (Regular, Gargantuan) with different behaviors
  - Sun resource collection system
  - Wave-based zombie attacks with increasing difficulty
  - Configurable game settings via external file

- **Technical Highlights**:
  - Event-driven architecture using SFML
  - Custom physics for projectile trajectories
  - Object-oriented design with inheritance
  - Dynamic game state management
  - Config file parsing for game balance
